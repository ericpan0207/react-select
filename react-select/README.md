# Custom Made Dropdown Component using React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run the project

1) Clone the repository 
2) `cd react-select` to get into the repository folder
3) run `git switch v2` to get to the right branch that I pushed the code to
4) If step 3 doesn't work, try `git checkout v2` and then `git pull origin v2`
4) `cd react-select` to get into the project folder
5) Run `npm install` to install dependencies
6) After all the dependencies are installed, run `npm start`

## Props for the react-select component
- `optionsProp`: Here you can pass in options that you want to be displayed in the dropdown
- `selectedProp`: This sets the initial state of the dropdown component and options that are selected appear on top of the component
- `multiselect`: toggle between single and multi select
